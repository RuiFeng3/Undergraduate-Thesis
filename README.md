This is my undergraduate thesis in School of Mathematics, Shandong University. The thesis is about statistical inference of the jump diffusion process. To be more specific, I construct the reweighted Nadaraya-Watson estimator for the unknown jump intensity function of continuous-time diffusion model with finite active jumps. Then I prove its asymptotic normality and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to show its finite sample performance.
